The front view is in Catalan because it was made for educational purposes, but all the internal code is in English so you can understand the code a little better.
To run the project you just have to download the repository, enter it with vscode and do npm install in the cli and then ng serve.
Feel free to look for bugs or improvements in the code to help me improve my coding skills, all feedback is welcome :)
